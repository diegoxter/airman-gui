# To Dos within the code

```
Search within the code for the term "TO DO" to find the leftover bugs.
```

Some that come to my mind:

1. A bunch of optimizations [WIP]
2. React Toast for transactions
3. Airdrop campaign cards inside the AirMan modal [DONE]
4. Refill tokens ERC20 interactions for AirMan [DONE]
5. User profile page [WIP]
6. Home page / admin page / profile filtering the airdrops
7. Token Contract input in DeployAirman modal needs better handling for wrong contracts
8. A button that gets ON when Manage campaign options accordion is OPEN [DONE]
